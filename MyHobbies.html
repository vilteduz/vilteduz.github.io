<h1 id="name">First Hobby</h1>
<p id="introduction">One of my biggest hobbies is dancing. It brings me happiness, and helps when I feel upset, I just get lost in my emotions and dance moves and just let my body flow. I forget all of the worries, things and people that are around me. Dancing has helped me through the hardest moments of my life and I will be forever grateful for that</P>

<h1 id="name">Second Hobby</h1>
<p id="introduction">My second hobby is horse riding. I don't think it is a very common thing that people like, but for me it is one of the best thigs ever. I fell in love with horses after I watched the movie "Racing Stripes". After that all of my life started spinning around horses. My mom putted me in riding classes and I was doing it for 5 years. But then I got an injury when the horse stepped on my foot, so I had to drop riding classes, which was very sad for me. Right now I'm not taking riding classes, but if I had a chance, I would do it in a heart beat</P>

<h1 id="name">Third Hobby</h1>
<p id="introduction">My last hobby would be cooking. This hobby of mine I found quite recently, on the first quarantine. Two years ago I used to hate cooking, maybe because I didn't know how to. And when he first quarantine started I decided to give it a go and after some practice, I understood that it is really relaxing thing. At first I mostly baked cakes or cupcakes and pies. And now as I moved to Germany, without my family, I've learned how to cook a lot of delicious meals, and I would say that I am quite good at it. And this is a picture of the cake that I have baked:</P>
